export const VERIFICATION_DISCLAIMER = `# Photo ID & Background Check Disclaimer

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Purpose of Verification

WrenchGo requires photo ID uploads and may conduct background checks to promote accountability and trust. However, these measures have important limitations.

## Photo ID Requirement

**All Users Must Upload Photo ID:**
- Government-issued identification (driver's license, passport, state ID)
- Used to verify that users are real people
- Helps create accountability on the platform

**What Photo ID Does NOT Guarantee:**
- That the person is who they claim to be
- That the ID is authentic or current
- That the person is qualified, trustworthy, or safe
- That the person has a valid driver's license or insurance
- That the person will fulfill their obligations

**Limitations:**
- IDs can be forged, stolen, or expired
- We perform basic verification but cannot guarantee authenticity
- Photo ID does not verify skills, qualifications, or character

## Background Checks for Mechanics

**What We Check:**
Mechanics may undergo background checks that may include:
- Criminal history records
- Sex offender registry
- Driving records
- Identity verification

**What We Do NOT Check:**
- Employment history
- Education or training
- Professional licenses or certifications
- Credit history
- Civil lawsuits or judgments
- References or recommendations

## Important Limitations of Background Checks

**Background checks are NOT perfect. They may:**
- Miss recent criminal activity (records take time to update)
- Contain errors or outdated information
- Fail to include records from all jurisdictions
- Miss crimes committed under different names
- Not reveal all relevant information about a person

**Background checks do NOT:**
- Guarantee safety, trustworthiness, or competence
- Predict future behavior
- Verify professional skills or qualifications
- Replace your own judgment and due diligence
- Constitute an endorsement or certification by WrenchGo

## What Background Check Results Mean

**"Passed" or "Clear":**
- Means no disqualifying records were found in the databases searched
- Does NOT mean the person has no criminal history
- Does NOT mean the person is safe, qualified, or trustworthy

**"Failed" or "Flagged":**
- Means potentially disqualifying records were found
- May result in account suspension or termination
- Does not necessarily mean the person is dangerous or unqualified

**"Pending":**
- Check is in progress
- Mechanic cannot accept jobs until check is complete
