## Welcome to WrenchGo

WrenchGo is a technology platform that connects customers who need automotive services with independent mechanics who offer those services. By using WrenchGo, you agree to these Terms of Service.

## What WrenchGo Does (and Doesn't Do)

WrenchGo provides a mobile app and website that allows:
- Customers to post service requests and receive quotes from mechanics
- Mechanics to view requests and submit quotes
- Both parties to communicate and arrange services
- Payment processing through our third-party provider, Stripe

**WrenchGo does not:**
- Employ mechanics or perform automotive work
- Guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of any services
- Verify the accuracy of user profiles, credentials, or background information
- Act as an insurer or guarantor of any transaction
- Control how mechanics perform their work

## Who Can Use WrenchGo

You must be at least 18 years old and legally able to enter into contracts. By creating an account, you confirm that all information you provide is accurate and current.

## For Customers

When you use WrenchGo as a customer:
- You are hiring mechanics directly, not hiring WrenchGo
- You are responsible for evaluating mechanics and making your own decisions
- You must upload a valid photo ID to request services
- You agree to pay the quoted price plus applicable platform fees
- You understand that WrenchGo does not guarantee any mechanic's work

## For Mechanics

When you use WrenchGo as a mechanic:
- You are an independent contractor, not an employee of WrenchGo
- You are responsible for your own licensing, insurance, and taxes
- You must upload a valid photo ID to offer services
- You may be subject to background checks (see Background Check Policy)
- You agree to pay platform fees as disclosed at the time of each transaction
- You are solely responsible for the quality and legality of your work

## Photo ID and Background Checks

**Photo ID Requirement:**
All users must upload a government-issued photo ID. This helps create accountability but does not guarantee identity, safety, or qualifications.

**Background Checks:**
Mechanics may undergo background checks. These checks:
- Are limited in scope and may not reveal all relevant information
- May contain errors or outdated information
- Are not endorsements, certifications, or guarantees of safety
- Do not replace your own judgment and due diligence

**You are responsible for your own safety.** WrenchGo does not verify, certify, or guarantee any user's identity, background, skills, or intentions.

## Payments and Fees

**Customer Fees:**
- Mechanic's quoted price for services
- Platform fee of $15 per transaction (may be reduced during promotions)
- All payments are processed securely through Stripe

**Mechanic Fees:**
- Platform commission of 12% on labor charges only (parts excluded)
- Maximum commission of $50 per transaction
- Fees may be reduced or waived during promotional periods

**General:**
- All fees are subject to change with notice
- Promotional discounts are temporary and may end at any time
- Refunds are handled according to our Refund Policy
- WrenchGo does not store your payment information

## User Conduct

You agree not to:
- Provide false information or impersonate others
- Use the platform for illegal purposes
- Harass, threaten, or harm other users
- Attempt to bypass payment through the platform
- Share your account credentials
- Use automated tools to access the platform

## Disputes Between Users

Disputes between customers and mechanics are between those parties. WrenchGo is not responsible for resolving disputes about service quality, pricing, or any other matter. We encourage users to communicate directly and resolve issues professionally.

## Limitation of Liability

**To the fullest extent permitted by law:**

WrenchGo provides the platform "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for:
- The actions, work, or conduct of any user
- Property damage or personal injury resulting from services
- Disputes between users
- Loss of data, profits, or business opportunities
- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages

**Our total liability to you for any claim is limited to the fees you paid to WrenchGo in the 12 months before the claim, or $100, whichever is less.**

## Indemnification

You agree to defend and hold harmless WrenchGo, its owners, employees, and partners from any claims, damages, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from:
- Your use of the platform
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any law or third-party rights
- Services performed by or for you through the platform

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account at any time for any reason, including violation of these Terms. You may close your account at any time through the app settings.

## Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

**Informal Resolution:**
If you have a dispute with WrenchGo, please contact us first at hello@wrenchgoapp.com. We'll work with you to resolve it.

**Binding Arbitration:**
If we can't resolve the dispute informally, you agree that any claim will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit and uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.

**Class Action Waiver:**
You agree to bring claims only in your individual capacity, not as part of a class action or representative proceeding.

**Exceptions:**
Either party may bring a claim in small claims court, and either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property infringement.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Illinois, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We'll notify you of material changes through the app or by email. Continued use of WrenchGo after changes means you accept the new Terms.
