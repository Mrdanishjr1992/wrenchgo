## How Payments Work

WrenchGo uses Stripe, a secure third-party payment processor, to handle all transactions. When you pay through WrenchGo, your payment information goes directly to Stripe—we never store your credit card or bank account details.

## Customer Fees

When you hire a mechanic through WrenchGo, you pay:

1. **Mechanic's Quote:** The price the mechanic sets for the service
