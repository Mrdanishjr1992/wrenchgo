export const REFUND_POLICY = `# Refund & Cancellation Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

This policy explains how refunds and cancellations work on WrenchGo. Because WrenchGo is a platform connecting customers and mechanics (not a service provider), refund decisions depend on the specific situation.

## Cancellations

**Before Work Begins:**
- Either party may cancel before the mechanic arrives or begins work
- Customers receive a full refund of all fees paid
- No cancellation fees apply

**After Work Begins:**
- Cancellations after work has started are subject to agreement between customer and mechanic
- The mechanic may be entitled to payment for work completed
- WrenchGo will work with both parties to reach a fair resolution

**No-Shows:**
- If a customer is not present at the agreed time and location, the mechanic may cancel and request compensation for travel time
- If a mechanic does not arrive within a reasonable time, the customer may cancel and receive a full refund

## Refunds for Service Issues

**Disputes About Work Quality:**
WrenchGo does not guarantee the quality of services performed by mechanics. If you're unhappy with the work:
1. Contact the mechanic directly to resolve the issue
2. If unresolved, contact WrenchGo support at hello@wrenchgoapp.com
3. We'll review the situation and may facilitate a resolution
4. Refunds are at WrenchGo's discretion and are not guaranteed

**Refunds We May Issue:**
- Full or partial refund of the platform fee
- In rare cases, facilitation of a refund from the mechanic (requires mechanic agreement)

**Refunds We Cannot Issue:**
- Refunds for work the mechanic has already completed
- Refunds for subjective quality complaints without clear evidence of defect
- Refunds for services performed outside the WrenchGo platform

## Platform Fee Refunds

The $15 platform fee (or discounted promotional fee) may be refunded if:
- The transaction was cancelled before work began
- There was a technical error with the platform
- The mechanic violated WrenchGo's Terms of Service
- WrenchGo determines a refund is appropriate

## Promotional Discounts

- Promotional discounts and codes are applied at the time of payment
- Promotions cannot be applied retroactively
- Promotional terms are subject to change
- Expired or invalid codes cannot be honored

## Payment Disputes

**Stripe Disputes:**
Payments are processed through Stripe. If you dispute a charge with your bank or credit card company:
- Your account may be suspended pending resolution
- You may be required to provide documentation
- Fraudulent disputes may result in permanent account termination

**Incorrect Charges:**
If you believe you were charged incorrectly, contact us immediately at hello@wrenchgoapp.com. We'll investigate and correct any errors.

## Refund Processing

**Timeline:**
- Approved refunds are processed within 5-7 business days
- Refunds appear on your original payment method
- Bank processing times may vary

**Partial Refunds:**
In some cases, we may issue partial refunds based on the circumstances.

## What WrenchGo Is Not Responsible For

We are not responsible for refunding:
- Services performed outside the platform
- Disputes between users that cannot be resolved
- Consequential damages or losses
- Work quality issues (though we'll try to help)

## Mechanic Payouts

**Payout Delays:**
Mechanics receive payment after services are completed and confirmed. Payouts may be delayed if:
- There's an active dispute
- Fraud is suspected
- Additional verification is needed

**Payout Cancellations:**
If a refund is issued to a customer, the corresponding mechanic payout will be adjusted or cancelled.
