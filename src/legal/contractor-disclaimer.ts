export const CONTRACTOR_DISCLAIMER = `# Independent Contractor Disclaimer

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Mechanics Are Independent Contractors

This is important: **Mechanics who use WrenchGo are independent contractors, not employees of WrenchGo.**

## What This Means

**Mechanics:**
- Own and operate their own businesses
- Set their own schedules and rates
- Provide their own tools and equipment
- Are responsible for their own licensing and insurance
- Pay their own taxes
- Make their own business decisions

**WrenchGo:**
- Does not employ mechanics
- Does not direct or control how mechanics perform work
- Does not provide tools, equipment, or training
- Does not guarantee mechanics' income
- Does not provide employee benefits
- Does not withhold taxes from mechanics' earnings

## No Employment Relationship

Nothing in WrenchGo's Terms of Service, this disclaimer, or the use of the platform creates an employment, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between WrenchGo and any mechanic.

## Mechanic Responsibilities

As an independent contractor, each mechanic is solely responsible for:

**Legal Compliance:**
- Obtaining required business licenses and permits
- Maintaining required automotive repair licenses or certifications
- Complying with local, state, and federal laws
- Obtaining necessary insurance coverage

**Taxes:**
- Reporting income to tax authorities
- Paying self-employment taxes
- Maintaining tax records
- Issuing receipts or invoices as required

**Insurance:**
- General liability insurance
- Professional liability insurance
- Vehicle insurance
- Workers' compensation (if applicable)

**Work Quality:**
- Performing services competently and safely
- Using appropriate tools and methods
- Complying with industry standards
- Honoring warranties or guarantees offered to customers

## Customer Understanding

Customers should understand that:
- They are hiring mechanics directly, not hiring WrenchGo
- WrenchGo does not supervise or control mechanics' work
- WrenchGo is not responsible for mechanics' actions or work quality
- Mechanics are independent businesses providing services

## Platform Fees Are Not Wages

The platform fees paid by mechanics are:
- Service fees for using the WrenchGo platform
- Not wages, salary, or employment compensation
- Subject to change based on WrenchGo's business decisions

## No Benefits Provided

WrenchGo does not provide mechanics with:
- Health insurance
- Retirement benefits
- Paid time off
- Unemployment insurance
- Workers' compensation
- Any other employee benefits

## Freedom and Flexibility

Mechanics have the freedom to:
- Accept or decline any service request
- Set their own rates (within platform guidelines)
- Work when and where they choose
- Use other platforms or find customers independently
- Operate their business as they see fit

## Termination

Because mechanics are not employees:
- WrenchGo may suspend or terminate platform access at any time
- Mechanics may stop using the platform at any time
- No notice period or severance is required
- This is not "firing" or "termination of employment"

## Dispute Resolution

Any disputes about the independent contractor relationship are subject to the arbitration provisions in the Terms of Service.

## State-Specific Laws

Some states have specific laws about independent contractor classification. This disclaimer is intended to comply with applicable laws. If you have questions about your classification, consult a legal or tax professional.

## Acknowledgment

By using WrenchGo as a mechanic, you acknowledge that you are an independent contractor and accept the responsibilities that come with that status.
