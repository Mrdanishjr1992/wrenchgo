1) UI labels (simple)
90–100: “Top Trusted”

75–89: “Verified Ready”

60–74: “Solid Choice”

<60: “New / Building Trust” (don’t shame — explain what improves it)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)🧠 Why this is the right architecture
🚀 One query = Explore page + map

🔐 RLS-safe (read-only view)

🧩 Directly matches your UI cards

⭐ Confidence score becomes a real trust signal

If you want next:

🔍 distance filtering (radius miles)

⚖️ sorting modes (closest / best rated / fastest)

📊 “why this score” breakdown for customers

Just say the word.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Map schema directly to your UI screens
Auth
Sign up / Sign in

auth.users, then create row in public.profiles

Customer flow
Home

customer identity: profiles

active jobs: jobs where customer_id = auth.uid()

notifications: notifications where user_id = auth.uid()

Explore (map + list)

mechanic card core: public.profiles (mechanic name/photo) + mechanics + mechanic_profiles

map point: mechanic_locations.location

badges: mechanic_skills → skills, mechanic_tools → tools, mechanic_safety → safety_measures

trust: mechanic_confidence_score(mechanic_id)

Mechanic detail (customer view)

profiles, mechanics, mechanic_profiles, mechanic_locations

join tables to show checklist groups

Create job

jobs insert with customer_id = auth.uid()

optionally vehicle_id from vehicles

Quotes

customer reads: quote_requests where customer_id = auth.uid()

Job progress

jobs (status/accepted_mechanic_id)

messages where job_id = …

Mechanic flow
Mechanic onboarding

mechanics (onboarding_completed, is_available, etc.)

mechanic_profiles (shop_name/bio/radius)

mechanic_locations (location)

checklist writes: mechanic_skills, mechanic_tools, mechanic_safety

schedule: mechanic_availability

Leads / jobs

mechanic reads jobs (searching) + gets assigned via quote_requests

once accepted: jobs.accepted_mechanic_id = auth.uid()

Inbox

messages where sender is mechanic OR job is assigned to mechanic

Want the next layer?
I can:

Design the exact UI flow (screen by screen)

Create the symptom → skill → quote mapping table

Write the mechanic quote copy templates

Turn this into App Store screenshots

Just tell me what you want next 👇

Want next?
I can:
----------------------------------------------------------
Auto‑generate follow‑up questions per symptom

Create the JSON payload saved on jobs

Design the mechanic quote UI that uses this mapping

Add confidence score impact per symptom handled

If you want, I can also add a second view for “Explore Leads” that filters jobs to the mechanic’s radius/zip and sorts by best match to their skills/tools.

Just tell me which one 👇


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Want next?
I can:

🔄 Auto‑map answers → quote strategy changes

🧠 Add confidence score boosts when mechanics handle certain symptoms

📘 Generate customer education cards per symptom

🧩 Wire this directly into your existing jobs schema (JSON payload)

| Strategy              | What customer sees                      | What mechanic does            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `diagnostic_only`     | “Inspection first, no guessing”         | Confirms issue before quoting |
| `range_quote`         | “Estimated range depending on findings” | Explains best/worst case      |
| `fixed_simple`        | “Clear price”                           | Low-risk services             |
| `inspection_required` | “Needs on-site assessment”              | Prevents unsafe quoting       |

5️⃣ How This Appears in the UI
Customer (simple)
Issue: Car won’t start
ℹ️ Most issues like this require a quick diagnosis before repair.
✔ No guessing
✔ Price explained before work

Mechanic (smart)
Likely Systems: Battery / Starter
Required Skills: Electrical, Diagnostics
Suggested Quote: Diagnostic
Risk: Medium
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI layout (simple and calming)
Card title
1–2 line summary
Chips:

✅ “What we’ll check”

🛟 “Is it safe to drive?”

💵 “How quotes work”

📸 “What to prepare”

Mechanic side
Show only:

“what_we_check”

“quote_expectation”

“red_flags”
(so it helps their initial response without lecturing)
