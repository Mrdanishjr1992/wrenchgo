# DO NOT APPLY - REFERENCE ONLY
# ================================
# This file prevents accidental application of archived migrations.
# The Supabase CLI only reads from supabase/migrations/ by default,
# but this file serves as an additional safeguard.
#
# If you see this file, you are in the WRONG directory.
# Use: supabase/migrations/ for active migrations.
