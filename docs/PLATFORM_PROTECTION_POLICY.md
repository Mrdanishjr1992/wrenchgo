# WrenchGo Platform Protection Policy

## Overview
WrenchGo requires all job-related communication to remain on the platform to protect both customers and mechanics. This policy explains why this matters, what's allowed, and the consequences of violations.

---

## Why Communication Must Stay On-Platform

### 1. **Payment Protection**
- All payments are secured through WrenchGo's escrow system
- Disputes can only be resolved for on-platform transactions
- Off-platform payments have no protection or recourse

### 2. **Complete Job History**
- Your entire conversation history is preserved
- Essential for warranty claims and repeat bookings
- Helps resolve disputes with documented evidence

### 3. **24/7 Support Access**
- Our support team can only assist with on-platform jobs
- Off-platform issues cannot be investigated or resolved
- Access to mediation and dispute resolution services

### 4. **Trust & Reputation**
- Reviews and ratings build your professional reputation
- Off-platform work doesn't count toward trust scores
- Badges and verification require documented platform activity

### 5. **Easy Rebooking**
- Find your favorite mechanics with one tap
- Preferred mechanics get reduced commission rates
- Automatic job history and preferences

## What's Allowed vs. What's Not

### ✅ **ALLOWED**
- Sharing business addresses and shop locations
- Part numbers, VIN numbers, and technical specifications
- Emergency contact during active jobs (with context)
- Warranty work coordination with previous mechanics
- Professional business cards after job completion
- Scheduling details and arrival times

### ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**
- Sharing phone numbers to move communication off-platform
- Email addresses for direct booking
- Social media handles to bypass the platform
- Payment apps (Venmo, CashApp, Zelle, etc.)
- Requests to "text me directly" or "call me instead"
- Obfuscated contact info (e.g., "five five five - 1234")

---

## How We Detect Violations

### Automated Detection
Our system scans messages for:
- Phone numbers (all formats, including obfuscated)
- Email addresses
- Social media handles
- Payment app usernames
- URLs and website links
- Common obfuscation patterns

### Context-Aware Scoring
The system considers:
- **Job Stage**: Stricter during pre-booking, more lenient during active jobs
- **Account History**: New accounts face higher scrutiny
- **User Reputation**: Completed jobs and positive reviews reduce false positives
- **Message Context**: Legitimate patterns (VINs, part numbers) are whitelisted

### False Positive Prevention
We automatically allow:
- Part numbers that resemble phone numbers
- VIN numbers
- Business addresses
- Technical specifications
- Legitimate emergency contact (with job context)
